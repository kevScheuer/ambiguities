:warning:**Architecture assumes AmpTools + halld_sim built with mpigpu**:warning:

`submit.py` is the main user interface that handles creating all the fits and submitting their jobs to slurm. 

To run your own fits, ensure the following:
1. Run `chmod +x run_mc.sh`
2. Specify your preferred AmpTools / halld_sim build paths in `setup_gluex.sh`

The process is as follows:
1. User requests their fits via `submit.py` (run with `-h` flag to see options)
2. For every pair of m=0 amplitude strengths and reflectivity ratios, a directory is created in `volatile` where 100 datasets, each a separate job, will be run
3. The same phasepace file for every dataset is generated with `generated_phasespace.cfg` and copied to the `volatile` dirs. This file is reaction dependent but model *independent*, and so only need be generated once for any m0-ratio pair
4. Begin iterating through each m0-ratio pairing:
   1. A common `fit.cfg` file is created that will fit every dataset generated by `generate_signal.cfg`. It uses the same model that was generated, but its parameters are allowed to float. 
   2. Jobs for all 100 datasets for are submitted. Each job executes the bash script `run_mc.sh` with job-specific variables.
   3. A separate job for the `truth.cfg` fit is sent. This cfg file is like `fit.cfg` but all values are fixed to the values generated in `generate_signal.cfg`, save for a single `scale` parameter that adjusts for the overall intensity that was randomly generated. This allows use to have "truth" values that we can compare our amplitude fit results to in each dataset
